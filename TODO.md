# CU3E — Open work

Single-page snapshot. Grouped by *when*, not by feature area.

---

## Strategic gates

**Pre-launch must-fix:**
- Rotate live API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`) — values appeared in chat history; rotate before any non-family user hits prod.
- Stand up the `partnerships@cu3e.co.za` mailbox referenced on `/contact` (the kenny@ card was replaced in the small-business-syndrome cleanup).
- Attach `cu3e.co.za` to Vercel + update DNS (currently a parked-domain page on Apache; testing happens on `cu3e-hazel.vercel.app`). Whenever Kenny wants to flip the public URL.

**Gated on "concept works → go to market":**
- **Unbundle ElevenLabs Conversational AI → direct TTS + Web Speech STT + our LLM.** Drops EL voice cost from ~$0.08/min session to ~10-20¢ per 5-min chat (~80-90% reduction). Same Echo voice (we already use EL TTS standalone for the weekly overview). ~1 day of focused work. Don't ship until subscription cost actually starts to matter.

## Voice-ergonomics polish (kiosk experience)

Mostly shipped, two open items:

- ~~Page-level Wake Lock on `/study-hub`~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-23. New `useWakeLock()` hook holds a screen lock for the whole study-hub session and re-acquires on visibilitychange. Tablet stays awake regardless of Android display-timeout settings.
- **Per-session voice minute budget** + UI cap. Belt-and-braces with the 45s auto-sleep — defends against runaway EL spend if any client-side detection ever misses.

## Echo Remembers — context staleness

- **Time-decay the memory brief so a new day = a fresher start.** Kenny on 2026-05-23: *"tatum started a new chat — and it went on about something from yesterday — so perhaps context can time out, so if its a new day it can start again"*. Current behaviour: `children.memory_brief` is a running 30-day Haiku summary, injected into every system prompt, leading with a "Last session" bullet. Great for resuming a chat that ended mid-thought a few hours ago; jarring when a 6yo starts a NEW chat the next morning and Echo opens with yesterday's specific topic she's already moved on from. Three layered fixes (pick one or combine):
  1. **Date-stamp every bullet in the brief** (Haiku prompt change) and instruct Echo in the system prompt to *only* surface a bullet proactively if the date is within the last 12 hours. Older bullets stay in context (for *if asked*) but Echo doesn't lead with them.
  2. **Conditional "Last session" bullet** — re-frame Haiku's first bullet only when the most recent `chat_messages.created_at` is within ~12 hours; otherwise omit the bullet entirely and let Echo open generically ("Hey Tatum, what's up today?").
  3. **Server-side opener decision** — in `/api/voice-session`'s opener-synth prompt, pass `hours_since_last_session` and instruct: "if > 12, open as if it's a fresh day; if ≤ 12, pick up where we left off". The opener stays warm-aware without being a stranger OR a stalker.

  **Recommended:** ship #3 first (smallest change, biggest UX win, only touches /api/voice-session). Then #1 as a follow-up so text chat gets the same intelligence. Don't ship all three at once — risk over-correcting and losing the continuity that's a real differentiator.

## Product

- **CAPS subject queue (build order).** Maths + English already shipped. Each new subject = one `seed_caps_*.py` script following the same pattern. Per-subject scripts intentionally stay independent (read end-to-end) — refactor into a shared `seed_lib.py` once we hit 5+.
  - ✅ Mathematics — 48 packs G1-9 (`seed_caps_foundation.py`)
  - ✅ English Home Language — 45 packs G1-9 (`seed_caps_english.py`)
  - ✅ Natural Sciences — 30 packs G4-9 (`seed_caps_natural_sciences.py`). Life, Matter, Energy, Earth.
  - **Afrikaans First Additional Language** — ~30 packs G1-9. Pairs with the Afrikaans voice (Charles Onselen). Vocab, grammar, basic reading.
  - **isiZulu First Additional Language** — ~30 packs G1-9. Waiting on native voice clone (Kenny's friend) for the voice side; text packs can ship independently.
  - **Life Skills (G1-3) → Life Orientation (G7-9)** — ~25 packs. Health, safety, social, civic.
  - **Social Sciences (History + Geography)** — ~35 packs G4-9 (two strands).
  - **Economic & Management Sciences** — ~12 packs G7-9. Money, business basics.
  - **Creative Arts** — ~12 packs G4-9. Visual, performance.
  - **Total full-CAPS catalogue ≈ 220 packs.** Library UI already has phase + subject filter chips so this scales without UX pain.
  - **Per-subject estimate:** ~3-4 hours of AI-generated content + human review per subject. ~2-3 days of focused work to ship the remaining 6 subjects end-to-end.
  - After CAPS is complete, repeat the pattern for Common Core (US), GCSE (UK), IB, AusCurriculum — same script template, swap region + content. Each is its own multi-week effort.

- **Multi-region curriculum library — pre-loaded starter packs.** This is a *promise made on the homepage FAQ* ("we're building starter packs for CAPS (SA), Common Core (US), GCSE/A-Levels (UK), IB, and the Australian Curriculum, one-click activate from the library"). The plumbing already exists — `curriculum_library` table, Library tile in study-hub, `/api/library/promote`, one-click activate flow. The gap is *content + curation*, not engineering. Scoping:

  **What "starter pack" should contain (per curriculum):**
  - Maths: 3-5 worksheet PDFs per grade (1-9), covering the major topics for that year. Grade 10-12 algebra/geometry/calculus for senior packs.
  - English: literacy/phonics packs for grades 1-4; comprehension + essay-prompt packs for grades 5-12.
  - Science: physical + life science worksheets, grades 4-12.
  - Optional v2: history, geography, second-language packs.

  **Content sourcing options (in order of legal cleanliness):**
  - Original CU3E worksheets — write our own from scratch. Slow, fully ours, no licensing risk. Could AI-generate first drafts and human-review.
  - Open-licensed material — Siyavula textbooks (CC BY-NC) for CAPS STEM, OpenStax for US, MIT OCW etc. Need to verify each license + attribute properly.
  - Public-domain past papers — many education ministries publish past exam papers. Free to host with attribution.
  - DO NOT host copyrighted publisher content (Macmillan, Pearson, Maskew Miller) without written permission.

  **MVP definition (one curriculum, proving the flow):**
  - Pick **CAPS** as the first pack (Kenny is SA, Tatum + Ella are CAPS, Siyavula CC content is available, the Library UI is already there).
  - Seed ~12-15 PDFs covering Foundation Phase maths + literacy (Grades 1-3) so Tatum is a real test case.
  - Each PDF needs `/api/extract-pdf` to run so it's queryable by Echo from upload.
  - Tag each row with `region`, `grade`, `subject`, `is_published=true`, `source_attribution`.

  **Engineering needed for MVP:** roughly zero — flow already exists end-to-end. Possibly a small filter UI ("Filter library by region/grade/subject") if the pack count grows.

  **Real-time estimate:** ~2-3 days per curriculum if AI-generating with human review; ~1 week+ per curriculum if hand-curating from open sources. Total to fulfil the FAQ promise: 2-6 weeks depending on depth + how many curricula we ship at v1.

  **Until this exists**, the FAQ answer is overpromising — soften the copy ("CAPS pack coming first, with others on the roadmap") OR build at least one pack before promoting the line.
- **Higgsfield Seedance for "story climax" video** — a standout moment per storybook generates a short animated video instead of a static image. Needs `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` + custom fetch integration.
- ~~Owl idle animation~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-23. Pure CSS — gentle breathe + occasional blink (brightness flash, weighted heavily toward eyes-open so it reads as a real blink). Applied to chat-header avatar + each Echo message bubble's avatar; staggered animation-delay so multiple owls don't blink in unison. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- ~~`/parents` deep-dive page~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-23. Reuses the real `ChildAnalytics`, `NotificationsBanner`, and (extracted) `CurriculumProgressCard` with mocked Tatum + Ella data so visitors see exactly what they'd get post-signup. Five slabs: hero, activity charts, breakthroughs, AI Skills progress, worksheet progress, Sunday-briefing recap, final CTA. Sunday-briefing homepage link now points at `/parents`. Header nav "For parents" same.

- ~~Multilingual support — Afrikaans first, then Zulu/Xhosa~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-23 with **Afrikaans AND isiZulu** simultaneously (Kenny: "then isiZulu please"). Migration 018 adds `children.preferred_language` with CHECK ('en','af','zu'). New `src/lib/languages.ts` is single source of truth — `buildLanguageDirective(code, name)` returns a language-specific system-prompt prefix that handles bilingual code-switching, age-appropriate register, and the English-for-technical-terms allowance for isiZulu. Wired into `/api/chat`, `/api/voice-llm`, and `/api/voice-session`. AddChildForm has a new "Echo speaks" picker, with inline per-child `ChildLanguagePicker` on the dashboard. Adding Xhosa later is one edit per file (lib + migration + UI option).
  - **UI itself stays in English** for MVP. Chat surface labels, buttons, mode names — all English. Echo's *output* is the Afrikaans/Zulu piece. Full UI i18n (next-intl) is the Phase 2 polish.

- **Native-voice TTS for Afrikaans + isiZulu** (real follow-up to the multilingual ship). Kenny tested Adele on Afrikaans → bad pronunciation. Investigation: **EL's public voice library has zero voices fine-tuned natively for Afrikaans or isiZulu**. The "South African" voices (Adele zx7xpccUD1nCkqUuxIGc, Thandi BcpjRWrYhDBHmOnetmBl, Charles Onselen IT5cb4lfodSX8eyXUzyO) are all listed as "Languages: en (south african)" — SA-accented *English* speakers. Feeding them non-English text → English-phoneme mispronunciation. Currently `lib/languages.ts` has `voiceId: null` for af/zu so we fall back to the agent's default voice (also English-trained — same problem, but at least it's the consistent Echo voice).
  - **Real options, ranked:**
    1. **Voice-clone a native speaker** (best long-term). Kenny records ~5 min of clean audio from a native Afrikaans speaker + native isiZulu speaker (Kenny's friend speaks Zulu — perfect candidate), uses EL's voice cloning to create custom voices, plugs the new voice IDs into `lib/languages.ts`. Authentic pronunciation, owned by Kenny's workspace.
    2. **Use Google TTS for non-English voices**. Google's Cloud TTS has native af-ZA and zu-ZA voices. Means routing TTS through Google for non-English sessions — more architectural work but high quality immediately.
    3. **Accept the limitation for now**. Text chat in Afrikaans/isiZulu works (LLM writes correctly). Voice mode stays English-only until cloning is done.
  - **Also discovered during testing:** EL agent's `platform_settings.overrides.conversation_config_override` had both `tts.voice_id: false` and `agent.language: false` from the original config — meaning **all voice overrides have been silently rejected, including the mature voice for 10+ shipped earlier**. PATCHed to `true` for both via direct API call. Mature voice (`ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_MATURE` env) should now actually take effect when set.
  - **Also discovered:** EL requires the agent's `language_presets` to include `'af'`/`'zu'` BEFORE accepting `overrides.agent.language` at session-start. Direct PATCH attempts to add these silently failed (possibly UI-only or premium-tier). Currently the agent.language override is disabled in `VoiceTalk.tsx` — so EL's STT defaults to English mode for Afrikaans/Zulu sessions. STT quality on non-English speech will degrade. Re-enable when the agent has proper language presets registered.

## Tech debt / paper cuts

- **`createServerClient` cookie API deprecation** — Supabase SSR is warning the old `cookies.get()` signature is deprecated. Migrate to `getAll`/`setAll`.
- **Migrate other pages to design-system tokens** — login / register / dashboard / skills / study-hub partially on inline styles. Should eventually use the same class-based system as the homepage.
